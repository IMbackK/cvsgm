  "body": "### Image segmentation.\r\nImage segmentation is a the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation) is the wikipedia article on Image segmentation.\r\n\r\n### Texture segmentation\r\nThe featured method partitions an image based on texture. It is an adaptation of [this](http://uk.mathworks.com/help/images/examples/texture-segmentation-using-texture-filters.html) Mathworks example into OpenCV.\r\n\r\n### Implemented functions\r\nSome of the functions implemented as steps of the featured texture segmentation method are:\r\n* entropyfilt: Returns a matrix, of the same size as the input image, where each pixel contains the entropy value of its 9x9 neighborhood.\r\n* calculateEntropy: Calculates the entropy of an image, as described [here](http://uk.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/entropy.html)\r\n\r\n### Borrows functions\r\n* bwareaopen: I found the code [here](http://opencv-code.com/quick-tips/code-replacement-for-matlabs-bwareaopen/)(I think) but I cannot access it any more. If someone know about the contributor please let me know.\r\n* imfill: The code comes from [here](http://www.learnopencv.com/filling-holes-in-an-image-using-opencv-python-c/).\r\n",
